Manpower is lost when you lose soldiers and manpower is generated at held sectors. Manpower can be collected at sectors and brough back to HQ to increase the factions manpower.

A sector will produce manpower once captured. If an enemy captures your sector you will lose whatever manpower was in that sector.

## Player vehicles

The player can get vehicles in HQ. These are free but will give a penalty if lost. If brough back to HQ the player can return the vehicle with no penalty.

### Start base (HQ)
Your startbase consists of an ammobox, ammo container, repair container and a medical container.

Your base will work as a spawnpoint for AI, but once sectors are captured infantry will preferably spawn there, while vehicles always will spawn in the start base.

Based on tier different vehicles and helicopters can also be bought in the start base. Infantry can be bought both in the startbase and in sectors.

You can also perform a halo insertion from the start base.
Spawn 2000 m over the ground at any point chosen by clicking on the map. Any teammates nearby will drop with you. 

### Heli taxi

When you are done with the heli taxi you can ask it to leave. 

There will be a time penalty between each time you can use the helicopter, and if its shot down there will be a longer penalty and also a manpower penalty.
